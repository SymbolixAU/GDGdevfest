## Elizabeth Stark: Something from nothing – bootstrapping a TensorFlow model from scratch

Many real world data science applications are perfect candidates for deep learning but few have access to the kind of data repository we need to train robust models. I’ll present a case study where we were commissioned to develop ‘Shazaam for frogs’ to help monitor waterway health. We can collect mountains of sound records, but tagging and preprocessing enough to get reliable training data is harder, especially before you’ve proved to the client the approach will work. I’ll talk about some tricks and tips to extend your data set, to interactively build and test models using the R Keras and Tensorflow libraries, and to start learning from nothing.
